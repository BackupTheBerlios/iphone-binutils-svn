To install:
% ./configure --prefix=/path_to/install --with-heavenly=/path_to_iphone_heavenly
% make

Notes:
- LLVM and LLVM-GCC are no longer automatically provided, to economize on our
host's bandwidth and to simplify development. You can get LLVM and LLVM-GCC
from <http://llvm.org/>. In both cases, version 2.0 must be compiled and
installed before you can build the toolchain.

- Because of the inter-dependencies between the sub-tools in the toolchain
"make" is compiling and installing files as well. We'll remove this hack
later.

- In order to prevent from conflicts or overwriting existing files on
your system, we suggest to set the --prefix path to a dedicated,
independant directory. the default prefix is /Developer/SDKs/iPhone
